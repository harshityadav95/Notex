### Week 0 :

## Track 1 - Introduction  

# Analysis of Algorithm  

* How do we find which algorith is better ? - Test Cases - Asymptotic Analysis
* Best Case(Omega Notation) , Average Case(Omega Notation), Worst Case (Big-Oh Notation)
* Shortcomings of Asymptotic analysis : Does not consider the difference caused by constants ie n^2 << n+c (where C might be large)
* [Analysis of Loops](https://telegra.ph/Analysis-of-Loops-06-11)

## Track 2 - Analysis of Recursion

*  General Method : Recurrion Tree Method
*  Requres Learning : Formula,Master Theorem 

## Track 3 - Time Complexity of a Computer Program 

* Cost of a statement, Number of times 
* O(1) < O(logn) <O(n) <O(nlogn) < O(n^c) < O(n!)
